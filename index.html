<h2> The Ultimate Guide : MIS and NRML</h2>
<p> What is MIS?


What is an NRML order?

What is NRML and MIS
“Overnight also” vs “intra-day only”

3 key points:
Intra-day vs overnight
Leverage
Auto-square off

Leverage
Back in the day, marking an order as MIS allowed you to take more leverage in your trading (whether cash segment or FnO segment), as long as the trading was intra-day. Now, you only get 5x leverage with MIS orders for cash, no extra leverage for FnO. However, trading in FnO is implicitly leveraged - see blogs.

Auto square off
As an FnO trader, you can think of an MIS order as a broker-level auto-square off algo.
But algos can fuck up, eg Kotak MIS fuckup - RESEARCH Chintan Jaggi
As a stock trader, you can use MIS to get leverage from your broker, as well as avail of the auto-square off functionality

Different brokers handle it differently
Different brokers have different MIS times

Tweet this, asking others to reply with their broker not listed
This page will be a master list of MIS cutoff times for brokers, with their respective web links if available
What about the order types? Do different brokers handle it with limit orders, or market orders?
Zerodha
IIFL
Angel one

How does it make a difference in our lives?
We’re FnO traders, for my intra-day strategies, I will use MIS. If there’s an intra-day strategy with my potential exit time being greater than the MIS cutoff time, then I will use NRML.
For positional trades/strategies, I will use NRML
